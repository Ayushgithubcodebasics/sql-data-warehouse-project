## üéØ Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and scalable data warehouse that consolidates sales and customer data from two disparate source systems: **ERP** and **CRM**. The final data warehouse provides a single source of truth, enabling efficient analytical reporting and informed business decision-making.

The project involves:
1.  **Designing** a modern, layered data architecture.
2.  **Developing** ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines to ingest, clean, and integrate data.
3.  **Modeling** the data into a user-friendly Star Schema optimized for analytics.
4.  **Documenting** the entire process, from data lineage to the final data model.

## ‚ú® Key Concepts & Skills Demonstrated

This project covers a wide range of essential skills in the data engineering and analytics domain:

-   **Data Architecture**: Implementation of the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) to ensure data quality and progressive refinement.
-   **ETL Development**:
    -   **Extract**: Bulk inserting data from flat files (`.csv`) into the data warehouse.
    -   **Transform**: Performing extensive data transformations, including:
        -   **Data Cleansing**: Handling `NULL`s, duplicates, invalid values, and unwanted spaces.
        -   **Data Standardization & Normalization**: Mapping coded values to user-friendly descriptions (e.g., 'M' to 'Male').
        -   **Data Integration**: Combining data from multiple source systems into a unified view.
        -   **Derived Columns & Business Logic**: Creating new columns and applying business rules.
    -   **Load**: Using Stored Procedures for batch processing with full load patterns (Truncate & Insert).
-   **Advanced SQL**: Utilizing Window Functions, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), and complex `JOIN`s.
-   **Data Modeling**: Designing and implementing a **Star Schema** with Fact and Dimension tables, ideal for BI and reporting tools.
-   **Database Design**: Creating tables, views, schemas, and stored procedures.
-   **Project Management**: Following a structured project plan with clear phases and tasks.

## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture

This project implements the **Medallion Architecture**, a modern data design pattern that logically organizes data into three distinct layers. This approach ensures that data is progressively cleaned, refined, and modeled as it flows through the system.

### ü•â Bronze Layer (Raw Data)
-   **Purpose**: Serves as the initial landing zone for raw data from source systems. The data is stored "as-is" with no transformations.
-   **Objects**: Tables.
-   **Key Benefit**: Provides a historical archive of source data, enabling traceability and the ability to rebuild subsequent layers without re-extracting from the source.

### ü•à Silver Layer (Cleansed & Standardized Data)
-   **Purpose**: Data from the Bronze layer is cleaned, conformed, and standardized. This is where data quality issues are addressed.
-   **Objects**: Tables.
-   **Key Benefit**: Provides a clean, reliable dataset for data analysts and data scientists to perform exploratory analysis.

### ü•á Gold Layer (Business-Ready Data)
-   **Purpose**: Data is transformed into a business-centric model, ready for consumption by BI tools and analysts. This layer features the final, integrated data model.
-   **Objects**: Views.
-   **Data Model**: Star Schema.
-   **Key Benefit**: Delivers a highly performant, easy-to-understand data model that directly supports business reporting and analytics use cases.

## ‚≠ê Data Model (Star Schema)

The Gold layer is modeled as a **Star Schema**, which is optimized for querying and BI analytics. It consists of one central fact table surrounded by two dimension tables.

-   **`fact_sales`**: Contains quantitative transactional data (the "facts"), such as sales amount and quantity. It includes foreign keys to the dimension tables.
-   **`dim_customers` & `dim_products`**: Contain descriptive attributes (the "dimensions") about customers and products, respectively. They provide the context for the facts.
